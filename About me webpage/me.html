		<p id="about-me">
			I'm 17 years old and I live in Fairfield, Connecticut. My favorite subject is math (when I can understand it)
			and I also like history. I swim for my school's swim team. I usually swim backstroke and freestyle, but I'm not very good.
			I go to Fairfield Ludlowe High School.
			I have one older brother named Ian. We kind of have a love-hate relationship.
			I love music and I play two instruments: the double bass and the piano.
			I was born in Jan. 29th, 2001 and my Chinese Zodiac is a dragon. I was born just in time to make the cut.
			My biggest fear is spiders and the dark. Both of them creep me out.
			My favorite TV show is Elmentary.
			My favorite show when I was younger was Avatar: The Last Airbender.
			I usually go on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> youtube <a/>. I'll put a link.

			I love cats, dogs, and other cute animals. Here's some pictures of my favorite types of cats and dogs:
